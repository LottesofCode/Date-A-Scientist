You can find the [full write up of this project in my portfolio.](https://lottesofcode.github.io/Portfolio/fastpages/jupyter/2022/06/22/date-a-scientist.html).

# Introduction
In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible romantic matches and optimize the user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth of information that weâ€™ve never had before about how different people experience romance.

## Scope
This project utilises information from dating platform OkCupid 2 in order to answer specific problems.

## Project Goals
There are two primary goals for this project. The first is to perform EDA - scoping, initial analysis and investigation) on the data, which will then be cleaned and prepared for use in several supervised machine learning algorithms. The second goal is to use this data to see if it is possible to determine the zodiac sign of a OkCupid member, using the information provided in their profile. Zodiac signs have been identified as an important attribute in the dating world, and as a portion of profiles do not provide this information, it would be useful for OkCupid to predict missing zodiac signs, in order to increase the likelihood of successful dating matches.
